# JarvOS - An AI-Enabled Co-Pilot

### ⚠️ STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️

## Introducing JarvOS

This is an open-source voice assistant that can help you interact with your life while your hands are busy. 

## Interaction design via LLMs

This project seeks to operationalize a concept that has dogged interface design since the advent of the ubiquitous touchscreen - hands-free interaction. Touchscreens are incredibly useful in many situations, combining the visual utility of a screen and the ease of tactile interactions. But they're not so great when you're using your hands and your eyes. Situations like driving, working with your hands, or cooking aren't suited for touchscreen interaction, and can be actively dangerous. 

JarvOS seeks to provide a proof-of-concept for a hands-free, eyes-free mode of interaction enabled by the advent of consumer Large Language Modes like ChatGPT and Llama 2.
